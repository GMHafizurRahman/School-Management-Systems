<h4>Outputs, Outcome, Impact

    </h4>
IsDB-BISEW has been operating a number of educational programmes for the
underprivileged Muslim youth since 2003. Meanwhile, the programmes have 
earned enormous reputation and success in local and overseas job markets. 
All the programmes have been maintaining an average of 92% direct job placement
of beneficiaries. It is really appreciable and praiseworthy contribution towards 
the economy of Bangladesh and strongly recommended for continuing the programmes 
in broader and extended domain.
