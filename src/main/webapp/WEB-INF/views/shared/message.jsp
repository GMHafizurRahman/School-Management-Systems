Professor Dr. Harun-or-Rashid 
Vice-Chancellor, National University

    Established in 21 October,
    1992 by an act of Parliament the National 
    University,Bangladesh has started its Journey. 
    It is an affiliating University of Bangladesh to 
    impart graduate and post-graduate level education 
    to the students through its affiliated colleges and 
    professional institutions throughout the country. For 
    that matter the University has been playing the most significant
    role in providing opportunities for higher education among the 
    students coming from rural and semi-rural background at an affordable
    means since its inception. It is almost an impossible task to run the 
    affairs of the University effectively concerning its currently 2300 
    ffiliated colleges and institutions from a single Headquarters by following
    a traditional method. Hence, apart from decentralization to Regional Centres,
    the present administration of the University has taken a number of measures to 
    turn it into a digitized University based on wholesale networking. This will 
    definitely help us overcome the colossal session jam from which the students 
    are currently suffering.


Further the administration has undertaken necessary steps to
transform the Gazipur campus into a Centre of Excellence with a
focus on higher research and learning at the post-graduate level leading 
to M. Phil and Ph.D. degrees at the Gazipur campus leaving the matter of 
imparting classroom education to the affiliated colleges and institutions.
In this era of globalization we can not afford to produce average graduates
but those of higher quality who can only compete globally. In this endeavour
and the fulfillment of our vision, I seek co-operation from all quarters.
